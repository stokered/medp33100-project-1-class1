    Something starts rumbling, and the stones start to shake.
    Some ancient curse rises through the small room and throws 
    it into a frenzy; the walls crumble around you with 
    astonishing force. You try to make it back to the hole and escape, 
    but it's too late. You are crushed under a pile of rubble,
    never to be seen again.
