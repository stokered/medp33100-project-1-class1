    You reach a dead end. Your heart sinks, but looking around
    you notice that there is a small hole, just big enough
    to crawl through. You look back at the water, but feel that the 
    note must have some significance. The hole doesn't look like natural erosion;
    it looks like someone has been here before. Maybe they left the note.

    Maybe that got out.

    You get down on your hands and knees.
