    The path gets darker the further you walk. 
    You continue on until you run into a stone wall. 
    Canvassing the brick with your hands, 
    you can feel an opening to your left. You could always
    turn back to the path with the water, although whose to 
    say the light doesnâ€™t run out there too?</h1>
