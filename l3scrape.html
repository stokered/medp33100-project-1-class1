    Whatever is inside sounds pretty delicate.
    You start rubbing the softened stone against 
    the dry stone of the wall.

    Still rubbing.

    If the stone wasn't wet, maybe you could make a fire.

    Finally, the stone makes a hissing sound as a small pocket
    of air emerges. You look inside and see a corked apothecary tube.
        <!-- include animation of tube if possible-->
    You open it and find a curled up piece of parchment.
