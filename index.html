      Your head throbs as you come to in a damp, claustrophobic hallway. 
      <br>
      The stone walls are lined with torches in iron brackets.
      <br>
      Who lit the torches? There is no sound of people; all you can hear is your own breath.
      <br>
      Behind you is a dead end. The only way is forward.
      <br>
      You can't remember your name or your age,
      only that you shouldn't be here. That you need to get out.
