<div class="text">
    You're already stuck down here, might as well.
    You nervously feel around when your hand makes contact.
    It's a withered stone, although it feels strangely hollow.
    You shake it near your ear and can hear something rattling inside.
        <!-- play rattling sound effect -->
    You need to open it, but how? 
    You could smash it against the wall, but you risk smashing whatever
    is inside if it's fragile. 
    Or you could try to scrape it against the stones of the wall,
    letting friction do its work, although it may take hours.
